Here is a Python code that demonstrates how to scrape health and wellness discussions from a website (e.g., Reddit), extract health-related information, apply sentiment analysis, and structure the data for use in AI-powered insights.

This code uses libraries such as BeautifulSoup, requests for scraping, spaCy for Natural Language Processing (NLP), and VADER for sentiment analysis.
Step-by-Step Python Code

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import spacy
from spacy import displacy
import re
import json
import pandas as pd
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Load pre-trained spaCy model for NER (Named Entity Recognition)
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Initialize VADER sentiment analyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Function to scrape Reddit posts (example)
def scrape_reddit_data(subreddit_url, num_posts=10):
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36"
    }
    # Sending a GET request to Reddit's page
    response = requests.get(subreddit_url, headers=headers)
    
    # Parse the page content with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract post titles and comments
    posts = []
    for post in soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'Post'}):
        title = post.find('h3')
        if title:
            posts.append({
                'title': title.get_text(),
                'url': post.find('a')['href']
            })
    
    return posts[:num_posts]

# Function to extract product mentions, brand names, and user sentiment
def extract_data(text):
    # NLP tokenization and named entity recognition (NER)
    doc = nlp(text)
    
    product_mentions = []
    brand_names = []
    user_sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)
    
    # Extract named entities (brands, ingredients, etc.)
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == 'ORG':
            brand_names.append(ent.text)
        if ent.label_ == 'PRODUCT':
            product_mentions.append(ent.text)
    
    return {
        'text': text,
        'product_mentions': product_mentions,
        'brand_names': brand_names,
        'sentiment': user_sentiment
    }

# Example function to simulate extracting health-related discussions from a source
def extract_health_data_from_forum():
    # Example Reddit URL to scrape data from
    subreddit_url = "https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/"
    
    # Scrape the first 10 posts
    posts = scrape_reddit_data(subreddit_url, num_posts=10)
    
    extracted_data = []
    
    # Extract relevant data for each post (product mentions, sentiment, etc.)
    for post in posts:
        post_url = post['url']
        post_title = post['title']
        
        # Example: Fetching the actual post content (you can extend this part to fetch comment data as well)
        post_content = requests.get(post_url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
        post_soup = BeautifulSoup(post_content.text, 'html.parser')
        post_text = post_soup.find('div', {'class': 'Post__content'}).get_text()
        
        # Extract health-related data (product mentions, sentiment)
        post_data = extract_data(post_text)
        
        # Add post title for reference
        post_data['title'] = post_title
        extracted_data.append(post_data)
    
    return extracted_data

# Function to clean and structure data into a usable format
def clean_and_structure_data(data):
    # Clean data (remove irrelevant, duplicated, or noisy content)
    cleaned_data = []
    for entry in data:
        # Example filter: Remove posts with minimal content or negative sentiment
        if len(entry['text'].split()) > 5 and entry['sentiment']['compound'] > -0.5:
            cleaned_data.append(entry)
    
    # Convert structured data into CSV, JSON, or database format (JSON as an example here)
    return json.dumps(cleaned_data, indent=4)

# Main function to execute the extraction, analysis, and structuring process
def main():
    # Extract health data from the forum
    extracted_data = extract_health_data_from_forum()
    
    # Clean and structure the extracted data
    structured_data = clean_and_structure_data(extracted_data)
    
    # Save the structured data to a JSON file
    with open('health_wellness_data.json', 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(structured_data, json_file, indent=4)
    
    # Optionally, convert structured data to DataFrame for further analysis
    df = pd.read_json('health_wellness_data.json')
    print(df.head())  # Print first 5 records of structured data
    
    print("Data extraction and NLP analysis completed successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Key Components:

    Data Scraping:
        We use requests to fetch Reddit data and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.
        Posts are scraped from a subreddit (e.g., SkincareAddiction) and stored in a list.

    NLP Analysis (via spaCy & VADER):
        spaCy is used to identify named entities in the posts (e.g., brand names, products).
        VADER is used for sentiment analysis to categorize user satisfaction (positive, negative, neutral).

    Data Extraction:
        The extract_data() function takes a post’s text, extracts product mentions, brand names, and sentiment.

    Data Structuring:
        The data is structured in a format that includes product mentions, brand names, and user sentiment, which can be saved as a JSON or CSV for further analysis.

    Data Cleaning:
        The function clean_and_structure_data() ensures that irrelevant or duplicate posts are removed and only valuable data is retained.

Example Output Format (JSON):

[
    {
        "text": "I’ve been using XYZ Cream for 3 months and it’s amazing! My skin feels smoother.",
        "product_mentions": ["XYZ Cream"],
        "brand_names": ["XYZ"],
        "sentiment": {"neg": 0.0, "neu": 0.33, "pos": 0.67, "compound": 0.25},
        "title": "My experience with XYZ Cream"
    },
    {
        "text": "The ABC Lotion gave me a rash. Not recommended at all.",
        "product_mentions": ["ABC Lotion"],
        "brand_names": ["ABC"],
        "sentiment": {"neg": 0.65, "neu": 0.35, "pos": 0.0, "compound": -0.75},
        "title": "Avoid ABC Lotion"
    }
]

Key Libraries:

    BeautifulSoup: For web scraping and parsing HTML.
    spaCy: For NLP tasks like tokenization and named entity recognition (NER).
    VADER: For sentiment analysis.
    pandas: For converting JSON into structured DataFrames (optional).
    requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch the content.

Requirements:

To run this code, you will need to install the following libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 spacy vaderSentiment pandas
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

This code gives you a strong foundation for scraping and analyzing health and wellness discussions, extracting valuable data about products, and applying sentiment analysis. You can further refine it by integrating it with a database, real-time data collection, or more advanced NLP techniques depending on your project's needs.
